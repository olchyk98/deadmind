\section* {Introduction}
What follows is the operators manual for bomb defusal containing all the knowledge we've learned fighting terror in our great country. We'd like to remind the operator that sharing this manual is grounds for capital treason. Under \textbf{NO} circumstances shall you render any part of the material visible to a third-party or we will prosecute you fully to the extent that the law allows us.

Thank you \& слава россии!
